","If the Blues were wine, Id be drunk all the time.","In Jerusalem, the skies are closer. ","If you count the thorns, the flower disappears. ","If I had plenty, Id be content with what I have. ","In Jerusalem, even the silence speaks. In Jerusalem, the Skies are Lower ","Words flow under a bridge of silence. ","Dry bones make good flutes ","Inside every widow theres a spider that weaves its webs in the corners of her heart.","So many lovers, yet there is no love.","To bend down for money is OK, but to bow is not.","Once, my wife would make me coffee. These days, she hardly puts the kettle on. ","When you have a full bouquet you cant sit back and smell each flower.","The Blues is an acoustic tear.","A cup of kindness is better than a whole bottle of mercy can be. "]

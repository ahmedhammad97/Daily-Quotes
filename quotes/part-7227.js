var author7227 = "Woe", quotes7227 = ["An Iliad of woes.","Waste brings woe, and sorrow hates despair.","When one is past, another care we have;Thus woe succeeds a woe, as wave a wave.","And woe succeeds to woe.","Long exercised in woes.","Woe unto you,â€¦ for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin.","So perish all whose breast neer learned to glowFor others good or melt at others woe.","I was not always a man of woe.","O, woe is me, Thave seen what I have seen, see what I see!","One woe doth tread upon anothers heelSo fast they follow.","All these woes shall serveFor sweet discourses in our time to come.","Woes, cluster; rare are solitary woes;They love a train, they tread each others heel."]

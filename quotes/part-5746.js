Through... the transitive nightfall of diamonds","Aint no time to hate, barely time to wait","Trouble ahead, Trouble behind, and you know that notion just crossed my mind","Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll.","Such a long, long time to be gone, and a short time to be here.","It seems like all this life was just a dream","Sometimes we live no particular way but our own","I like your smile but I aint your type, Dont shake the tree when the fruit aint ripe","Crippled but free, I was blind all the time I was learning to see.","Inspiration, move me brightly, light the song with sense and color, hold away despair","Aint nobody messin with you but you","But never give your love, my friend, Unto a foolish heart"]

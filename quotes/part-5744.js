Why this, as some approve:The sure, sweet cement, glue, and lime of love.","A sweet disorder in the dressKindles in clothes a wantonness.","You say to me-wards your affections strong;Pray love me little, so you love me long.","Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt;Nothings so hard but search will find it out.","Get up, sweet Slug-a-bed, and seeThe dew bespangling herb and tree.","Tis sin,Nay, profanation to keep in.","Then while time serves, and we are but decaying.Come, my Corinna, come, lets go a Maying.","Art quickens nature; care will make a face; Neglected beauty perisheth apace."]

var author4678 = "Misers", quotes4678 = ["A mere madness, to live like a wretch, and die rich.","Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill;Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still.","His heart is like a maggot-eaten nut:Theres nothing in it ; but tis closely shut. ","The unsunnd heapsOf misers treasures.","Decrepit miser; base, ignoble wretch;I am descended of a gentler blood.","Misers are evil people,"]
